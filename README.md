# Boggle Solver
Inspired by Zack Wixom's [sudoku solver](https://github.com/z-wix/sudoku) I wanted to write a script that provides all possible words in a game of Boggle.

I love speed word games. Slow word games like Scrabble, not so much. Get me on Boggle, Big Boggle, Super Big Boggle, Banagrams or Snatch-It and I feel in my element. Boggle is my definitive go-to game though.

Its not even about winning. If I see a new word in Boggle that I have never gotten before I am happy. I'm happy when other people get those words. I'm happy to find those words after the round is over, just frustrated I didn't get them in regulation.

They show 'Boggle' and right off the bat I see:

Bog

toggle

elm

grit

grub

grubs

rub

rubs

stub

trite

gird

ride

stride

tide

You have 3 minutes to write down as many words as you can find. When the round is over you compare words. You will only get points for words you have that no one else has. i.e. if someone else wrote down 'ride' and 'stride' you will cross them off your list.

### The point system of Boggle is as follows:
- Each 3 and 4 letter words will earn you one point.
- A 5-letter word will award you two points.
- A 6-letter word will give you three points.
- A 7-letter word will award you five points.
- And finally, any word with eight or more letters will give you eleven points.
