# Boggle Solver
Inspired by Zack Wixom's [sudoku solver](https://github.com/z-wix/sudoku) I wanted to write a script that provides all possible words in a game of Boggle.

I love speed word games. Slow word games like Scrabble, not so much. Get me on Boggle, Big Boggle, Super Big Boggle, Banagrams or Snatch-It and I feel in my element. Boggle is my definitive go-to game though.

Its not even about winning. If I see a new word in Boggle that I have never gotten before I am happy. I'm happy when other people get those words. I'm happy to find those words after the round is over, just frustrated I didn't get them in regulation.
